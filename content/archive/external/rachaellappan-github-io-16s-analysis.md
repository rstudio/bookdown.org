Documentation describing my analyses of 16S rRNA sequencing data. [...] My name is Rachael Lappan, and I am a PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia. The core of my PhD work is the Perth Otitis Media Microbiome (biOMe) study, where I work on the upper respiratory tract microbiome in children with recurrent acute otitis media (middle ear infections). The first stage of this research involved characterising the microbiome (by 16S rRNA gene sequencing) on samples from children with ear infections compared with samples from seemingly resistant healthy controls. The paper can be ...
