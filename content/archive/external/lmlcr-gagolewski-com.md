Explore some of the most fundamental algorithms which have stood the test of time and provide the basis for innovative solutions in data-driven AI. Learn how to use the R language for implementing various stages of data processing and modelling activities. Appreciate mathematics as the universal language for formalising data-intense problems and communicating their solutions. The book is for you if you’re yet to be fluent with university-level linear algebra, calculus and probability theory or you’ve forgotten all the maths you’ve ever learned, and are seeking a gentle, yet thorough, introduction to the topic.
