Jürgen Wilbert Version 23.05 (build 7) Hello everyone! I am glad that you have found your way to this book as it tells me that you are starting to use the scan package. While scan is quite thoroughly developed, this book is at an early stage (about 40% done). I am constantly working on it and expanding it. At the moment there is no release version of this book. Only this draft, which most likely contains many errors.
If you have any suggestions on how to improve the book, or want to report bugs, comments, feedback, etc., go to the gitHub repository of this book and contribute here ...
