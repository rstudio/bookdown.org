Machine learning algorithms usually operate as black boxes and it is unclear how they derived a certain decision. This book is a guide for practitioners to make machine learning decisions interpretable. [...] Machine learning has great potential for improving products, processes and research. But computers usually do not explain their predictions which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning. This book is about making machine learning models and their decisions interpretable. After exploring the concepts of interpretability, you will learn about simple, interpretable models such as ...
