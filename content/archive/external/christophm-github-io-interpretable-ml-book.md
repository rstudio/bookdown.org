Christoph Molnar Machine learning is part of our products, processes, and research. But computers usually donâ€™t explain their predictions, which can cause many problems, ranging from trust issues to undetected bugs. This book is about making machine learning models and their decisions interpretable. After exploring the concepts of interpretability, you will learn about simple, interpretable models such as decision trees and linear regression. The focus of the book is on model-agnostic methods for interpreting black box models. Some model-agnostic methods like LIME and Shapley values can be ...
