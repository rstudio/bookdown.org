This book will teach you how to use R to solve your statistical, data science and machine learning problems. Importing data, computing descriptive statistics, running regressions (or more complex machine learning models) and generating reports are some of the topics covered. No previous experience with R is needed. [...] This book is still being written. Chapters 1 to 8 are almost ready, but more content is being added

too and more are coming. You can purchase an ebook version of this book on leanpub. ...
