Complex heatmaps are efficient to visualize associations between different sources of data sets and reveal potential patterns. Here the ComplexHeatmap R package provides a highly flexible way to arrange multiple heatmaps and supports various annotation graphics. This book is the complete reference to ComplexHeatmap pacakge. [...] This is the documentation of the
ComplexHeatmap package. Examples in the book
are generated under version 2.9.3. You can get a stable Bioconductor version from http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html, but the most up-to-date version is ...
