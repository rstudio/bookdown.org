Behavior Analysis with Machine Learning Using R teaches you how to train machine learning models in the R programming language to make sense of behavioral data collected with sensors and stored in electronic records. This book introduces machine learning concepts and algorithms applied to a diverse set of behavior analysis problems by focusing on practical aspects. Some of the topics include how to: Build supervised models to predict indoor locations based on Wi-Fi signals, recognize physical activities from smartphone sensors, use unsupervised learning to discover criminal behavioral patterns, build deep learning models to analyze electromyography signals, CNNs to detect smiles in images and much more.
