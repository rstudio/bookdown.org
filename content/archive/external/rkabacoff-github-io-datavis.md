A guide to creating modern data visualizations with R. Starting with data preparation, topics include how to create effective univariate, bivariate, and multivariate graphs. In addition specialized graphs including geographic maps, the display of change over time, flow diagrams, interactive graphs, and graphs that help with the interpret statistical models are included. Focus is on the 45 most popular graph types. The guide also includes detailed instructions on how to customizing graphs, and ends with a chapter on graphing best practices. Although strongly based on the ggplot2 package, other approaches are included as well.
