Or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the t-SNEs. [...] This is the landing page for the “Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor” book,
which teaches users some common workflows for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq).
This book will show you how to make use of cutting-edge Bioconductor tools to process, analyze, visualize, and explore scRNA-seq data.
Additionally, it serves as an online companion for the paper of the same name. The goal of this book is to provide a solid foundation in the usage of Bioconductor tools for single-cell RNA-seq analysis by ...
