Your future is bright, your future needs coding. Welcome to coding your future. This guidebook will teach you how to design, build, test and code your future in computing. Youâ€™ll be introduced to professional issues in computer science, exploring techniques for making career decisions, job searching, writing applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace. Alongside the practical engineering issues of coding and testing your future, this guidebook also encourages you to design your future by taking a step back and thinking more strategically. You will apply computational thinking techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people, what your experience is to date and where you want to be in the future.
