This is a book experiment for MAT 4880 Mathematical Modeling II. [...] Example 1.1 We are given population data concerning the growth of a species of yeast in a closed vessel. Use the data given below and the solution \(u(t)\) to the logistic differential equation to find estimates of the parameters \(u_0\), \(r\) and \(K\). \[u(t) = \frac{K}{1+e^{-rt} \left (\frac{K}{u_0}-1 \right )}\]
where \(K\) is the carrying capacity of the population, \(r\) is the growth rate and \(u_0\) is the initial population size at time \(t=0\). For more details, please review the lectures where we covered all ...
