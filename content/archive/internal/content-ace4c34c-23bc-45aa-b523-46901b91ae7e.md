This is a free, activity-based introductory statistics class, suitable for high-school and college students. The course is designed around active learning, statistical modeling, and simulation-based inference. Students use Monte Carlo Simulation to model variability, and they make conclusions based on the outcomes of their models. This book is part of the free Statistical Reasoning: A Modeling and Simulation Approach curriculum.
