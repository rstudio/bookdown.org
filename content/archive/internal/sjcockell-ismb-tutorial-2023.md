This book will guide you through the practical steps of the in-person tutorial IP2 for the ISMB/ECCB 2023 conference in Lyon named: Spatial transcriptomics data analysis: theory and practice. [...] This book will guide you through the practical steps of the in-person tutorial IP2 for the ISMB/ECCB 2023 conference in Lyon named: “Spatial transcriptomics data analysis: theory and practice”. Recent technological advances have led to the application of RNA Sequencing in situ. This allows for whole-transcriptome characterisation, at approaching single-cell resolution, while retaining the spatial ...
