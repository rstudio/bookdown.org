Practical 6 - Variable Selection [...] After attending this lab, you should be able to use R to: In Chapter 3 of the lectures, we explored the use of confidence intervals in the selection of a model. We
had already seen the use of \(R^2\) as a measure of the modelâ€™s goodness of fit and residual plots to check assumptions. These methods work best when there are only a small number of explanatory variables. We shall explore another technique for model selection. One approach to model selection is to start with a model containing all variables and use an automatic approach in order to determine ...
