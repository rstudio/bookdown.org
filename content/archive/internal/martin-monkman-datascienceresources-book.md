A modest and very incomplete listing of resources for tackling data science problems in R. [...] Draft This book grew out of my evergrowing collection of reference materials that was saved as an expanding array of markdown files in a github repo. By assembling it as a book, I hope that it will be more accessible and useful to other R users. The author would like to acknowledge everyone who has contributed to the books, articles, blog posts, and R packages cited within.
