Practical 2 - Understanding correlation and further exploring relationships [...] After attending this lab, you should be able to use R to: In the lectures we learned how to assess the strength of a linear relationship between random variables using the correlation coefficient. The population correlation is a measure of the magnitude of the strength of the relationship between two random variables X and Y, and is defined as \[\begin{equation}
\rho(X,Y) = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(X)\text{Var}(Y)}},
\tag{1.1}
\end{equation}\] and can be estimated by replacing each of ...
