R versions of the array manipulation functions of APL are presented. We do not translate the system functions or other parts of the runtime. Also, the current version has does not have the nested arrays of APL2. [...] APL was introduced by Iverson (1962). It is an array language, with many functions to manipulate multidimensional arrays. R also has multidimensional arrays, but not as many functions to work with them. In R there are no scalars, there are vectors of length one. For a vector x in R we have dim(x) equal to NULL and length(x) > 0. For an array, including a matrix, we have ...
