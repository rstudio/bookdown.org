This is an example of using the bookdown package to write a 'book' for a lab. The output format for this example is bookdown::gitbook. [...] Intended learning outcomes: produce scatterplots of report quality; fit linear regression models by using lm; interpret least squares estimates of model parameters; calculate least squares estimates of model parameters for simple linear regression. In the lectures we have examined relationships between variables using scatterplots. We have considered
how to fit a linear model, through estimating the parameters such as \(\beta\) in the linear model \(Y_i = ...
