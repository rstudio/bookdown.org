Applied Omics Science for Drug Discovery and Development [...] The lab module includes four sections: This course will cover several of the statistical concepts and data analytic skills needed to succeed in data-driven life science research as it relates to genomics and the omic sciences. For the bulk of the course we cover topics related to genomics and high-dimensional data. Here we cover experimental techniques used in genomics including RNA-seq and variant analysis. We start with an introduction to R, including data structures, data wrangling and plotting methods. We then we walk you ...
