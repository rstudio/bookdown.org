This book is a guide for getting started using the Rasch model [...] This is meant to be a general introduction for using the Rasch model via R for constructing measures. The book is meant to get you started but is by no means where you should stop. Please see, Wilson (2005) and Bond & Fox (2015) for more. The Rasch model is based on a theory of measurement. Whereas one may typically fine-tune a model to fit the data, in the Rasch paradigm, one compares the data to the Rasch model. Under this view, when the data does not fit the Rasch model, it is believed that the data may not be suitable ...
