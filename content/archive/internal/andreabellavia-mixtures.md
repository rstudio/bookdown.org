Humans are simultaneously exposed to a large number of environmental hazards. To allow a more accurate identification of the risks associated with environmental exposures and developing more targeted public health interventions, it is crucial that population-based studies account for the complexity of such exposures as environmental mixtures. This poses several analytic challenges and often requires the use of extensions of standard regression approaches or more flexible techinques for high-dimensional data. This document presents an extended version of the class material that was used in an introductory two-weeks course on statistical approaches for environmental mixtures. The main challanges and limitations of standard regression techniques are outlined, and recent methodological developments are introduced in a rigorous yet non-theoretical way. The course was designed for students and postdocs in environmental health with basic preliminary knoweldge on linear and logistic regression models. Sources and code examples to conduct a thorough analysis in R are also included.
