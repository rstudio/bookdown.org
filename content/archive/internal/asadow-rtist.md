How do you get inspired to write in R? Many books teach you what to write, but not how to find inspiration. This book starts from the ground up. You’ve just installed R and RStudio - what do you do now? What’s the quickest, smartest way to get results? I’ll show you how to get there, line-by-line, step-by-step. At some point, in trying to get your own work done, you will get stuck. But I’ll also show you how to get unstuck in mere minutes. Finally, I’ll show you how to write in a way that will prevent you from getting stuck in the first place! This will keep you in the flow of writing beautiful, intentional R code.
