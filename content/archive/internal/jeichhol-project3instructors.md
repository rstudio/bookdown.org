This is the Project 3 for Math 142, Spring 2025 [...] In this project we will derive ODEs that govern the motion of a small satellite as it orbits the earth, and as it returns to earth. We will consider the influence of both the earth and the moon. Though our discussion is limited to the satellite, earth, and moon, the exact same ideas apply to all objects in the galaxy (so long as you donâ€™t try to account for relativistic effects). We will restrict ourselves to a two-dimensional model of space, but a three-dimensional model would not be hard to include. It would, however, include more ...
