Pharmacy Primer for T-SQL Database Interrogation is a manual intended for pharmacist SQL practitioners at a beginner to intermediate skill level. It approaches the topic of Microsoft Transact-SQL (T-SQL) database interrogation from the HFHS perspective using pharmacy use cases from real-world projects. The manual makes an up-front investment in foundational SQL theory that (hopefully) rewards the user with more nuanced and targeted examples in its later materials.
