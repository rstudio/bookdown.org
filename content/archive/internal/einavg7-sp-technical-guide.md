A technical guide for mapping rooftop solar potential in a city using open source data and software. [...] In 1990, cities accounted for 45% of global final energy use, but by the end of 2020, this share had risen to approximately 75% and cities release a similar share of global energy-related CO₂ emissions. Today, most of the world’s energy supply is generated from fossil fuels, coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy, and their use has a negative impact on the world’s economy, ecology, and climate.1 Therefore, the use and need for renewable energy ...
