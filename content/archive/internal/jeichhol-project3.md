This is the Project 3 for Math 142, Spring 2025 [...] In this project we will derive ODEs that govern the motion of a small satellite as it orbits the earth, as it orbits the moon, and as it returns to earth. We will consider the influence of both the gravitational force from the Earth and the moon, as well as the effect of drag once the satellite enters the Earth’s atmosphere. Though our discussion is limited to the satellite, earth, and moon, the exact same ideas apply to all objects in the galaxy (so long as you don’t try to account for relativistic effects). We will restrict ourselves to ...
