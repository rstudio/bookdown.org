Machine Learning for Biostatistics [...] So far, most of the methods that we have seen (with the exception of KNN) assume
an additive effect of the predictors. We will now study non-parametric methods
to estimate \(f(\mathbf x)\). By the end of this module you should be able to: The dataset triceps is available in the MultiKink package.
You may install.packages("MultiKink"), load the library (library(MultiKink))
