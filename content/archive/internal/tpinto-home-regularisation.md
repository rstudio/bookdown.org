Machine Learning for Biostatistics [...] In this module we will talk about model selection and regularisation methods (also called
penalisation methods), namely, ridge and lasso. We will start with classical
algorithms for model selection, such as the best subset selection and stepwise
(backward and forward) selection. Then we introduce the idea of bias-variance
trade-off and the motivation for ridge regression. Finally, we will talk about
Lasso regression and some of its extensions. By the end of this module you should be able to: The dataset fat is available in the library(faraway). You ...
