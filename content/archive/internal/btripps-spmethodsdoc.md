This is a bookdown generated website containing the methods documentation used for generating the spatially priorised layers under the LNR pilot scheme, collating expert information and data from Defra group bodies aimed for spatially planning what actions should be suggested to landowners across England. Each outcome has its own chapter explaining the data which has gone into a prioritisation layer, the rationale behind it and further improvements which could be explored in future developments of the scheme.
