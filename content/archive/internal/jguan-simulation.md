This is a demo of our simulation. [...] This is a detailed demo of a simulation to test the sensitivity of PLIS procedure and conventional p-value procedure using logistics regression. While PLIS procedure incorporates the correlation among SNPs to adjust for Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), conducting multiple logistics regressions assumes that SNPs are independent from one another. The main idea here: We donâ€™t have info for all SNPs along our chromosomes for research. Thus, when missing the data for true causal SNPs, we want to detect the SNPs that are physically close to the causal SNPs so ...
