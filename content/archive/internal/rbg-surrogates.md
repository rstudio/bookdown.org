Surrogates: a new graduate level textbook on topics lying at the interface between machine learning, spatial statistics, computer simulation, meta-modeling (i.e., emulation), and design of experiments. Gaussian process emphasis facilitates flexible nonparametric and nonlinear modeling, with applications to uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, calibration of computer models to field data, sequential design and (blackbox) optimization under uncertainty. Presentation targets numerically competent scientists in the engineering, physical, and biological sciences. Treatment includes historical perspective and canonical examples, but primarily concentrates on modern statistical methods, computation and implementation in R at modern scale. Rmarkdown facilitates a fully reproducible tour complete with motivation from, application to, and illustration with, compelling real-data examples.
