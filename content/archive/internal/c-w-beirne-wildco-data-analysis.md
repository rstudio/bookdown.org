This resource is a 'living document' representing useful data exploration and data analysis workflows we use within the WildCo lab, WildCAM network and (hopefully) beyond. [...] This guide was made as a way of sharing our research labs collective knowledge on the management, manipulation and analysis of camera trap data. It was born out of the realization that many analysis frameworks we apply as camera trappers, do not have specific examples which involve camera trap data. Thus we wanted a resource which takes a single data set from raw data to analysis, showing all of the steps in between! ...
