[...] This ebook is based on the second edition of Richard McElreath’s (2020b) text, Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan. My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul Bürkner’s brms package (Bürkner, 2017, 2018, 2020a), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R (R ...
