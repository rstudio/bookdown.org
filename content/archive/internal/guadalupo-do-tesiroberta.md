TESI DI LAUREA SPERIMENTALE IN GIS E PERICOLOSITA’ IDROGEOMORFOLOGICA [...] A fault is a planar fracture of the earth’s crust that places two parts of the earth’s rock (fault blocks) in internal contact that slide relative to each other due to forces on the Earth. A fault is roughly described as a plane defined by dip-direction/dip and a slip vector defined by trend and dip. Depending on the direction of the main ones involved, the fault plane assumes a typical spatial arrangement, and the two fault blocks will move (relative displacement) with different kinematics. Movement along a fault can  ...
