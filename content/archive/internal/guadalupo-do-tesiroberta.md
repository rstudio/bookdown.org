TESI DI LAUREA SPERIMENTALE IN GIS E PERICOLOSITA’ IDROGEOMORFOLOGICA [...] A fault is a planar fracture of the earth’s crust that places two parts of the earth’s rock (fault blocks) in internal contact that slide relative to each other due to forces on the Earth. A fault is roughly described as a plane of cut defined by orientation (strike), slope (dip) and direction of movement (rake). Depending on the direction of the main ones involved, the fault plane assumes a typical spatial arrangement (orientation and slope) and the two fault blocks will move forces (relative displacement) with ...
