ecode, a novel package for modelling ecological populations and communities using ordinary differential equation systems, designed with a user-friendly framework. By following a three-cycle procedure, users can easily construct ecological models and explore their behaviors through a wide range of graphical, analytical, and numerical techniques. The package incorporates advanced techniques such as grid search methods and simulated annealing algorithms, enabling users to iteratively refine their models and achieve accurate predictions. Notably, ecode minimises external dependencies, ensuring ...
