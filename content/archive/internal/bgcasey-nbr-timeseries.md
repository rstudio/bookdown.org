This is document walks through the analyses I performed for this research. [...] The following workflow can be used to extract a time series of Landsat Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) using Google Earth Engine and the LandTrendr change detection algorithm.1 See (1.1) for a definitions of the spectral change metrics extracted via Landtrendr. The workflow presented was developed and provided to me by Jen Hird (University of Calgary | Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute, 2020). I adapted it for chapter 3 of my PhD thesis. The following code javascript and r code are used in this workflow: ...
