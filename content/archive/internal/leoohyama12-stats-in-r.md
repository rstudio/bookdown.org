<p>This is a trial run of putting out a book for a stats class.
The HTML output format for this example is bookdown::gitbook,
set in the _output.yml file.</p> [...] This is a book written in Markdown for ENY 4654 at the University of Florida. It is still in progress. This book is meant to be used in conjunction with the class lectures and is in no way meant to replace lectures. With that being said, this book is a valuable resource that can hopefully address questions you may have on class materials. Feel free to copy and paste the code made available from it for other research ...
