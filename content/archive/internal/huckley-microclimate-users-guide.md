A usersâ€™ guide to accessing and processing microclimate datasets. [...] Most ecological analyses and forecasts use weather station data or coarse interpolated, gridded temperature data. Yet, these products often poorly capture the microclimates experienced by organisms that live near the surface and respond to fine scale spatial and temporal environmental variation. Sources of historic and projected future data that better capture microclimates are proliferating. This site attempts to make it easier for users to access and process microclimate data. We include weather station data along with ...
