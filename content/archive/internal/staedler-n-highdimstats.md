This book is for the CAS Module High-dimensional statistics [...] This book is thought as accompanying material for the course on High-dimensional statistics. The content is heavily based on other work (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2001). We will typically denote an input variable by the symbol \(X\). If \(X\) is a vector, its components can be accessed by subscripts \(X_j\). Quantative outputs will be denoted by \(Y\), and qualitative outputs by \(G\) (for group). We use uppercase letters such as \(X\), \(Y\) or \(G\) when referring to the generic aspects of a variable. Observed values ...
