<p>A Short Course on Nonparametric Curve Estimation. MSc in Applied Mathematics.
EAFIT University (Colombia).</p> [...] This course is intended to provide an introduction to nonparametric estimation of the density and regression functions from, mostly, the perspective of kernel smoothing. The emphasis is placed in building intuition behind the methods, gaining insights into their asymptotic properties, and showing their application through the use of statistical software. The software employed in the course is the statistical language R and its most common IDE (Integrated Development ...
