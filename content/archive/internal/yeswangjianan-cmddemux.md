This is a tutorial of CMDdemux. [...] Multiplexing technology is widely used in single-cell experiments. It involves labeling cells from different samples with chemical tags, such as antibody-based tags (Stoeckius et al. 2018), lipid (McGinnis et al. 2019) or cholesterol tags (McGinnis et al. 2019), or fluorescent proteins (Guo et al. 2019). After labeling, cells from different samples are pooled together for sequencing. During downstream analysis, the abundance of these tags (often called hashtags) is used to determine the sample of origin for each single cell. Multiplexing has several ...
