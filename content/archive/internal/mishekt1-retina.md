Abstract [...] This projectâ€™s aim is to understand the extent to which signaling by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is affected by degeneration. Rod photoreceptor death is a form of retinal degeneration that alters the wiring of the retina and can eventually leads to blindness. As the retina loses the ability to transmit visual scenes to the brain, there are changes in the signaling across the light spectrum that the human eye detects. A potential measure for visual signaling is the information content that the RGCs sends through their action potentials and the precision with which they send ...
