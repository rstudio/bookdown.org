This is a bookdown containing results of our analysis of the phenotype data collected on the maize x teosinte hybrids during the 2019 and 2020 field season. [...] As part of our effort to characterize the 'hybrid decay' phenotype described in Xue et al. 2019, we have collected phenotypic data for several sick hybrid lineages. All lineages descend from a Bravo Teosinte x W22 Maize hybrid backcrossed 7 times to W22 we received from John Doebley. We denote this hybrid as sW22 (may also be refered to as a Bravo BC7), and it is the earliest "sickly" phenotype we have. We start by first detailing ...
