Each emerged largely independent of the other, and social scientists tend to view the two approaches as useful for addressing fundamentally different research questions. Causal inference—the randomized experiment in particular—is the gold standard for testing hypothesized mechanisms, prioritizing theory and interpretability. By contrast, machine learning tends to be preferred when the goal is to make useful predictions, ...
