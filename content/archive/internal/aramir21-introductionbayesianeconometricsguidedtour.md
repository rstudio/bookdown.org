The subject of this textbook is Bayesian data modeling, with the primary aim of providing an introduction to its theoretical foundations and facilitating the application of Bayesian inference using a GUI. [...] Since the late 90s, Bayesian inference has gained significant popularity among researchers due to the computational revolution and the availability of algorithms to solve complex integrals. However, many researchers, students, and practitioners still lack a deep understanding and practical application of this inferential approach. The primary reason for this is the requirement for ...
