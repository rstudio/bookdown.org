These are the course notes for the Machine Learning and Neural Networks module (MATH3431) at Durham University. [...] Welcome to the material for the first half of the Machine Learning and Neural Networks module (MATH3431) at Durham University. These pages consist of relevant lecture notes will be updated as the course progresses. I would recommend that you use the html version of these notes (they have been designed for use in this way), however, there is also a pdf version of these notes.
