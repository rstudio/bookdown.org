In this bookdown, a Turing machine is implemeted and some example programs are presented. Then, a function for creating animated gifs of a Turing machine is implemented, and we see some concrete examples on such gifs, using the already defined example programs. [...] This is a bookdown created using rmarkdown. Code cannot be run directly in the book, but all necessary code is available so you can run it in your own R-session. If you want to try playing with the implemented functions or running some example programs yourself, remember to run all necessary functions, so you have them in your ...
