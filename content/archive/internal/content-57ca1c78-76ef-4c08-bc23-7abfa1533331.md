This involves a series of coding sessions for ST429. [...] Coding sessions for ST429 are included here. In these programming sessions, we will apply some statistical and computational techniques to practical problems in risk management. Each session is designed to reinforce your understanding of the theoretical concepts by implementing them in R, working through real or simulated data examples. R is a free software environment for statistical analysis and graphical visualisation. You can download R, access its documentation, and find answers to common questions from The R Project for ...
