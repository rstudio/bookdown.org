RNAdegrDocs [...] We need datasets such as genelist, coverage pileup, and sampleInfo to obtain the sample quality index outputs and plots.
geneInfo is optional if you want to compare results by the properties of genes. The description of Input data and variable names is listed as follows: This example consists of 1,000 selected genes among protein coding and lncRNA genes and fresh frozen and total RNA-seq (FFT) 171 samples, which can be found in data.
