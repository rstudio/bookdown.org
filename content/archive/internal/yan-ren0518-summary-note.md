Set coalash dataset as an example (Figure 1.1). \(D\) is the region with values. and \(s\) indicates percent of coalash in this location. Many kinds of exploratory statistics can be applied here to test stationarity, local stationarity and so on. The key idea in this chapter is to model the above random process \(\{Z(s),s\in D\}\) with values on known locations. Then inference of unknown locations can be made. Variogram is ...
