Chen Peng Omics technologies have found extensive applications in biology, encompassing disciplines such as microbiome studies, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and beyond. These technologies generate diverse datasets based on distinct methodologies. Following specific upstream processing, omics data is often transformed into feature abundance tables, representing entities like genes, metabolites, or taxa. These feature abundance tables, coupled with experimental design metadata and various annotation data, serve as the foundation for downstream bioinformatics analysis and visualization, ...
