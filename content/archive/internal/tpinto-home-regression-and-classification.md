Machine Learning for Biostatistics [...] This module will cover traditional methods for prediction of continuous outcomes
and categorical ones. In machine learning, these methods are known as
regression (for continuous outcomes) and classification (for categorical
outcomes) methods. This sometimes is a bit confusing given that,
despite its name, logistic regression is a classification method under
this terminology because in statistics, regression is used to refer to many models
