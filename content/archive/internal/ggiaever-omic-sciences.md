Genetics and genomics are undergoing an unparalled revolution in terms of technical capabilities and their impact on human health. Similar advances are ocurring for studying all the proteins within a cell (proteomics) and in our ability to manage and analyze all of the resulting data. These increases in our understanding of biology and human health can create breakthroughs in disease treatment and brings the prospect of personalized medicine closer to practical reality. This course will, through the lens of Pharmaceutical Science, provide an introduction and review of the general principles of genomics and molecular biology. Students will then explore the key genomic technologies and computational approaches that are driving advances in prognostics, diagnostics and treatment. Students will learn how scientists sequence,assemble and analyze structure and function of genomes and explore methods for determining the heretibility of traits and diseases by studying the larger population. Students will also learn how advanced functional genomics techniques can be applied to help develop new therapeutic strategies against major diseases. Fingally, we will survey key related advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics that are enabling rapied, highly-multiplexed characterization of protein function in health and disease. This course will give students a detailed understanding of how omics technologies and data processing methods can be harnessed for pharmaceutical research applications.
