About mathematical matrices and their meaning. [...] A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It serves as a fundamental tool in mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, to represent and manipulate data. Matrices are used to perform a variety of operations, such as solving systems of linear equations, representing transformations in geometry, and handling data in computer science. Matrices are integral to linear algebra, providing a structured way to solve systems of linear equations and perform linear transformations. They can represent coefficients of ...
