To save time. Many students and staff spend days and weeks wrestling with R code to prepare data for analysis. This resource is a valuable addition to conventional resources that are structured around function types. It illustrates the workflow, highlighting which functions are important to know and how to piece them together. Example coding is given to overcome many ways in which data can be messy, making practical tasks far easier to deliver. One PhD supervisor spent ages before they realised that the lack of an appropriate ID variable was the reason why their student couldnâ€™t merge their ...
