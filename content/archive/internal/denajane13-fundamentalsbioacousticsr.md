Fundamentals of bioacoustics using smartphones and R [...] The purpose of this lab exercise is to introduce students to bioacoustics, or the study of animal sounds and their habitats. For the field component, students use their smartphones to collect focal recordings of target animals as well as collect acoustic data that will be used to investigate variation in soundscapes at different times (e.g. dawn and dusk) and/or different locations (e.g. urban versus rural). The computer lab component utilizes the R programming environment to import sound files and visualize differences in acoustic ...
