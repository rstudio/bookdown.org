This containes all the supplementary materials for the paper named SpaceX: Gene Co-expression Network Estimation for Spatial Transcriptomics. [...] The spatial transcriptomics method depicts the positioning of a single cell on a spatially structured tissue. Knowledge about gene expressions and the spatial distribution of mRNA allows us to uncover cellular and subcellular heterogeneity in tissues, tumors, and immune cells. Spatial transcriptomics provides a unique opportunity to decipher both the cellular and subcellular architecture in both tissues and individual cells along with detection of  ...
