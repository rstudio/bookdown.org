This is a minimal example of using the bookdown package to write a book. The output format for this example is bookdown::gitbook. [...] A circle \(O\) has radius 10, AB and CD are two chords of the circle. \(AB \parallel BC\), \(AB = 12\), \(CD=16\), what’s the distance between AB and CD? Triangle \(ABC\), \(AB=AC\), \(\angle ABC = 30^o\). \(BD\) is a diameter of \(\triangle ABC\)’s circumsribe circle, \(CD=\frac{4\sqrt 3}{3}\), AD=? \(AB\) is a chord of circle \(O\). \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AB\). \(EC\perp OA\), BD is a tangent line of Circle \(O\). \(AB=12\), \(BD=5\). What is the radius  ...
