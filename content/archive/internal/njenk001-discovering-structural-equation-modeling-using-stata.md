This project replicates the Stata code in Acocks’s (2013) text with R, the tidyverse, and lavaan. [...] This project is a guide through Alan Acock’s Discovering Structural Equation Modeling Using Stata in R using the Tidyverse, and lavaan packages. The data needed to replicate the analyses in the book can be found on the book’s website here: Discovering Structural Equation Modeling Using Stata. My goal is to show how to fit these models in R and visualize their results. This is also, ver much, a work in progress. I assume that you have some familiarity with R and the tidyverse and won’t spend  ...
