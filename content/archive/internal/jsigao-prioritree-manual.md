PrioriTree is an interactive browser utility—distributed as an R package (see https://jsigao.shinyapps.io/prioritree/ for a demo of the utility)—designed to help researchers specify input files for—and process output files from—analyses of biogeographic history performed using the BEAST software package (Drummond et al. 2012; Suchard et al. 2018).
The discrete-geographic models implemented in BEAST (Lemey et al. 2009; Edwards et al. 2011) contain many parameters that must be inferred from minimal information (the single geographic area in which each pathogen occurs); inferences under this ...
