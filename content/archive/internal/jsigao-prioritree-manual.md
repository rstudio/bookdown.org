PrioriTree (https://jsigao.shinyapps.io/prioritree/) is an interactive web utility designed to help researchers specify input files for—and process output files from—analyses of biogeographic history performed using the BEAST software package [Drummond et al. (2012); Suchardetal2018].
The discrete-geographic models implemented in BEAST (Lemey et al. 2009; Edwards et al. 2011) contain many parameters that must be inferred from minimal information (the single geographic area in which each pathogen occurs); inferences under this approach are therefore inherently sensitive to the assumed priors on ...
