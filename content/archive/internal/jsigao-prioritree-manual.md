PrioriTree is an interactive web application (https://jsigao.shinyapps.io/prioritree/) to help researchers set up BEAST phylodynamic analyses to infer biogeographic history (focussed on prior specification and evaluation).
Its development is motivated by properties of the discrete-biogeographic models implemented in BEAST (Lemey et al. 2009; Edwards et al. 2011) and issues with the commonly used default priors in BEAST, identified by Gao et al. (2021) (see the paper for detailed discussions). These biogeographic models contain many parameters that must be inferred from minimal information ...
