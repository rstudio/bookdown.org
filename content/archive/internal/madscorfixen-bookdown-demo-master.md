P2 - Simulering af Data [...] The aim of the project was to identify alternatives to classical inference methods if the assumptions of these were not met and evaluate their performance. To examine this question, a classical inference method, the t-test, and how it can be used for hypothesis testing, is described. Furthermore, it is shown how the programming language R can be utilized to perform these simulations quickly and simply. Then, by means of simulations, it is examined whether the results are credible if the samples are not normally distributed when working with an unpaired t-test. ...
