These are my personal notes related to supervised machine learning techniques. [...] Machine learning (ML) develops algorithms to identify patterns in data (unsupervised ML) or make predictions and inferences (supervised ML). Supervised ML trains the machine to learn from prior examples to predict either a categorical outcome (classification) or a numeric outcome (regression), or to infer the relationships between the outcome and its explanatory variables. Two early forms of supervised ML are linear regression (OLS) and generalized linear models (GLM) (Poisson and logistic regression). These ...
