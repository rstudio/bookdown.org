Towards building stock decarbonisation: A streamlined algorithm for Measurement and Verification at scale. [...] This project used Highfield Campus, Southampton, as a case study to demonstrate
how the energy modelling process can be streamlined at scale.
The algorithm shown is able to individually create 3 parameter change point models for each building in a
large dataset simultaneously, whilst uniquely selecting the best fitting balance point for each. This document will explain how the code can be replicated or customised for use in
other datasets.
The full repository can be found on Github here.  ...
