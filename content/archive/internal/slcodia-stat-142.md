STAT 142: Introduction to Computational Statistics [...] Computational data analysis plays a crucial role in modern statistics. Skilled statisticians must go beyond simply running existing programs—they need to understand the underlying principles that drive them. Additionally, they should be able to read, modify, and write code, enabling them to develop the computational tools necessary to address their data-analysis challenges, rather than reshaping problems to fit pre-existing tools. Definition 0.1 Computational statistics is defined as a collection of techniques that have a strong “focus ...
