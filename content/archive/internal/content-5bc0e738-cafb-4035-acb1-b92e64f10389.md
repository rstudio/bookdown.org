This book is the official documentation for the R package IsoriX. [...] This bookdown (a particular form of R documentation) provides information on how to use the R package IsoriX.

Please consider this document as dynamic, in the sense that we will keep revising and improving it for as long as we keep developing IsoriX.  ...
