This project is an attempt to re-express the code in Kruschke’s (2014) textbook. His models are re-fit in brms, plots are redone with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code predominantly follows the tidyverse style. [...] Kruschke began his text with “This book explains how to actually do Bayesian data analysis, by real people (like you), for realistic data (like yours).” In the same way, this project is designed to help those real people do Bayesian data analysis. My contribution is converting Kruschke’s JAGS code for use in Bürkner’s brms package, which makes it easier to fit Bayesian  ...
