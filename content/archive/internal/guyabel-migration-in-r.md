In many countries and regions, migration is becoming or already is the largest component of population change. However, migration data is often of poor quality, missing or provided without disaggregation. Methods to estimate migration have been developed by demographers and alike to help address shortfalls and provide a platform to better understand migration patterns and trends. This manaul explores methods for measuring, estimating and visualising migration, and their implementation in R. Readers will become familiar with useful R functions for handling migration data, a range of measures to summarise and compare migration systems, common estimation methods to overcome inadequate or missing migration data and recently developed methods to visualize migration patterns. Code samples and exercises are provided throughout the manual to build up the readers experience. Some prior knowledge is required on how to handle and plot data using the tidyverse set of R packages.
