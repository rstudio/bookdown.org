I think everyone wishes they understood statistics better but it is easy to become overwhelmed with equations and proofs. Most of my knowledge in both math and statistics is self-taught through experience and exploration. This book is an organized assortment of simulations and examples that have personally helped me think through these difficult topics. Inspiration for this ...
