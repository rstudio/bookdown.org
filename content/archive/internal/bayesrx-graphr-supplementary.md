This containes all the supplementary materials for the paper named GraphR: a probabilistic modeling framework for genomic networks incorporating sample heterogeneity. [...] Network modeling are widely used in biomedical research, aiming to estimate and visualize complicated dependency structures in various fields and at different level. Graphically, networks compromise a set of variables (nodes) and relationships among nodes which are referred as edges. Under the assumption that: (1) edges represent partial correlation between nodes; (2) nodes follow Gaussian distribution, leading to a ...
