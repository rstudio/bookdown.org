Deep Learning in R: A Data-Analytic Viewpoint [...] Throughout these notes, I use R and RStudio (various versions) running on macOS Catalina (version 10.15.4) on a late-2015 iMac with a 3.2 GHz Intel Core i5,
8 GB memory and an AMD (i.e.Â non-Nvidia) graphics card. Not having an Nvidia graphics card means I cannot use the GPU version of TensorFlow (the backend, or computational engine for Keras) so we will not be demonstrating this way of accelerating computations. Chances are this chapter may also be useful if your machine runs Linux, but things may be entirely different on Windows. Keras is ...
