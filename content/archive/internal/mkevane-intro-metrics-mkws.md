This book is an introductory textbook for courses in basic quantitative data analysis. The emphasis is on regression analysis, where the analyst seeks to estimate the parameters that describe a causal relationship. An example is used consistently throughout the book: the relationship between educational attainment and adult wages later in life. The book introduces the student to R and RStudio, statistical computing software that is commonly used in academic, government, civil society, and corporate settings. R is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R computing environment provides the data management, data wrangling, analysis, and visualization tools needed for virtually all analysis. The book is appropriate for students in Economics, Development Studies, Political Science, and Sociology.
