Cognitive Foundations is a free, open, collaboratively-authored textbook. It is an introduction to cognitive psychology written at the foundational level. This collaborative OER book project represents the work of dozens of authors and collaborators. The first edition brought multiple open texts together, edited into a single book with a consistent voice and formatting. For the second edition, a team of content experts reviewed and updated the materials.
