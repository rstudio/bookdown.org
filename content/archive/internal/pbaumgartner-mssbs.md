This book accompanies “Rand, W. (2017). Modern Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences: A Practical Introduction, Second Edition (New edition). Boca Raton, FL: Taylor & Francis Inc.”. I intend to learn and explore the concepts and procedures taught in this introductory book. Please keep in mind that this book is just a kind of training exercise for me. There will be no new insights presented, and as I am still learning the basics of R and statistics, you may find misunderstandings and errors in my writings. For authoritative reference, you have the consult the original book.
