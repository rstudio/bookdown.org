Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) is an emerging research method that is based on necessity logic. If a condition is not present, the outcome will not exist. Other factors cannot compensate for its absence. This is different from common causal reasoning where factors produce the outcome and can be compensated. The book intends to support users, readers and reviewers of NCA to better understand the method.
