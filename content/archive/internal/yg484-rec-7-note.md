This is the class note for recitation 7. [...] Note that the plot might be different. In this plot, the simulated line is heavily influenced by the extreme value at around \((9,-10)\). One way to make linear models more robust is to use a different distance measure. For example, instead of root-mean-squared distance, you could use mean-absolute distance: We can see that the simulated line is less affected by the extreme value. One challenge with performing numerical optimization is that it’s only guaranteed to find one local optimum. What’s the problem with optimizing a three parameter model ...
