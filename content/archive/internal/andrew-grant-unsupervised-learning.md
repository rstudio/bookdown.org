Machine Learning for Biostatistics [...] Supervised learning, in machine learning, refers to methods that are applied
when we want to estimate the function \(f(X)\)
that relates a group of predictors \(X\) to a measured outcome \(Y\).
Unsupervised learning refers to methods that learn from the data but
there is no observed outcome. In this module, we will cover several unsupervised learning methods, namely
principal components analysis, k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. By the end of this module you should be able to: The dataset fat is available in the library(faraway). You may need ...
