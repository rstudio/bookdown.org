The Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, established by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in response to the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992, aims to enhance the education of technicians in high-technology fields such as advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, and information technologies, with a focus on two-year colleges. This report presents findings from the 2024 ATE survey, conducted by EvaluATE at Western Michigan University, which gathered data from ATE principal investigators with active grants. Covering grantee activities, achievements, and initiatives from 2023, the survey includes topics such as academic program development, professional development, student support, and research outputs.
