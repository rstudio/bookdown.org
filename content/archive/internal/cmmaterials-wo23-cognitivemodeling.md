<p>Welcome to the “code session”. In this website, we will use R to explore the concepts of
cognitive modeling introduced in the first hour using R.</p> [...] This week, you will learn basic R functions, including calculations (e.g., +, -, x, /), loops, and logical operations, commonly used in transforming equations into programming language. In addition to these functions, you need to understand the meaning of each notation in the equation and where to find the values for each notation. Usually, this information is explicitly described in the paper. Let’s set aside cognitive models for now ...
