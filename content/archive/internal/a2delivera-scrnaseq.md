This is an introduction to using RUV-III-NB (Salim et al. 2022) for removing unwanted variations from single cell RNA sequencing data. [...] This is an introduction to using RUV-III-NB for removing unwanted variation from single cell RNA sequencing data (Salim et al. 2022). The first section RUV-III-NB model below briefly explains the statistical methodology behind RUV-III-NB. Readers who are not interested in the methodology can move straight to Preliminary settings. RUV-III-NB models the raw count for gene \(g\) and cell \(c\), \(y_{gc}\), as Negative Binomial (NB), \(y_{gc} \sim ...
