<p>This is a minimal example of using the bookdown package to write a book.

In these papers, it is assumed that the data can be represented by a multivariate Gaussian linear model. The model has the following form: \[\begin{equation} y_i \sim N(X_i \beta;\Sigma_i ), \quad i =1, \dots,n \tag{1.1}
\end{equation}\] where \(y_i\) \((T_i \times ...
