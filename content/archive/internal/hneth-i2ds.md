This book provides a gentle introduction to data science for students of any discipline with little or no background in data analysis or computer programming. Based on notions of representation, measurement, and modeling, we examine key data types (e.g., logicals, numbers, text) and learn to clean, summarize, transform, and visualize (rectangular) data. By reflecting on the relations between representations, tasks, and tools, the course promotes data literacy and cultivates reproducible research practices that precede and enable practical uses of programming or statistics. This book is still being written and revised. It currently serves as a scaffold for a curriculum that will be filled with content as we go along.
