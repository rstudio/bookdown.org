This book provides a gentle introduction to data science for students of any discipline with little or no background in data analysis or computer programming. Based on notions of representation, measurement, and modeling, we examine key data types (e.g., logicals, numbers, text) and learn to clean, summarize, transform, and visualize (rectangular) data. Rather than promoting the latest technologies, we focus on the general goals and principles of data analysis. Reflecting on issues of design and asking why some tool is suited to tackle some task prevents us from getting stuck in niches and prepares us for a world in which many software frameworks can continue to evolve. By reflecting on the relations between representations, tasks, and tools, the course promotes data literacy and cultivates reproducible research practices that precede and enable practical uses of programming or statistics. This book is still being written and revised. It currently serves as a scaffold for a curriculum that is being filled with content as we go along.
