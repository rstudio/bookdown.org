For example, suppose it was believed that in general, the average cholesterol level was \(\mu = 5.0\) mmol/L. Further suppose the cholesterol levels of 72 patients were measured, and we wanted to ascertain: Is the average cholesterol level of patients from this population different from 5.0 mmol/L? To answer this question, we can use perhaps the most famous  ...
