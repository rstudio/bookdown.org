Vignette for the PreProcSEQ pipeline [...] Introducing the PreProcSEQ pipeline, a pipeline that takes the first steps necessary for analyzing RNA-Seq data. We cover everything from quality control (QC) to the construction of the gene expression matrix, covering essential topics for removing technical effects such as normalization and batch effect removal. The repository GitHub - resendejss contains the scripts and directory structure for the pipeline execution.  ...
