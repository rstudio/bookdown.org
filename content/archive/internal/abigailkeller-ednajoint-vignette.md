eDNAjoint: R package for interpreting paired or semi-paired environmental DNA and traditional surveys [...] This vignette provides examples and use cases of functions in the eDNAjoint package, as well as more details about the model that can be fit with eDNAjoint. The primary purpose of the joint model is to use observations from both environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys and traditional surveys (i.e., seine sampling, trap sampling, etc.) to understand the relative sensitivities of the two survey types. The model uses both streams to data to jointly estimate parameters like expected catch rate, ...
