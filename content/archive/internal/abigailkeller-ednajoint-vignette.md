This vignette provides examples and use cases of functions in the eDNAjoint package, as well as more details about the model that can be fit with eDNAjoint. The primary purpose of the joint model is to use observations from both environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys and traditional surveys (i.e., seine sampling, trap sampling, etc.) to jointly estimate parameters like expected catch rate, \(\mu\), at a site and false positive probability of eDNA detection, \(p_{10}\). The model is intended for use with paired, replicated eDNA and traditional observations at multiple sites across the landscape. ...
