Notes for STA 440/441 at Murray State University for students in Dr. Christopher Mecklin’s class. [...] Let’s start with an informal notion of probability, where we try to assign a numerical percentage or proportion or fraction to something happening. For example, you might be interested in the chance that it will rain tomorrow. How would you go about assigning a numerical value to this event? This would be an example of the subjective approach to probability, based on an event that cannot be repeated, although a weather forecaster might run many simulations of a weather model (which would be  ...
