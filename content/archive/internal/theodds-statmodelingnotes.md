<p>These notes cover the second semester in a two-semester sequence on
statistical modeling. It focuses on constructing, drawing conclusions from,
and critiquing probabilistic models. Planned topics include generalized
linear models, the bootstrap, hierarchichal models, nonparametric estimation,
and generalized estimating equations.</p> [...] In this collection of notes, we briefly outline the main thrust of this course
by discussing (at a high level of generality) the topic of probabilitic
modeling. Throughout this course we will focus on the application of
probabilistic modeling with an eye ...
