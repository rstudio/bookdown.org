This project is an attempt to re-express the code in McElreath’s textbook. His models are re-fit in brms, plots are redone with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code predominantly follows the tidyverse style. [...] I love McElreath’s (2015) Statistical rethinking text. It’s the entry-level textbook for applied researchers I spent years looking for. McElreath’s freely-available lectures on the book are really great, too. However, I prefer using Bürkner’s brms package (Bürkner, 2017, 2018, 2022i) when doing Bayesian regression in R. It’s just spectacular. I also prefer plotting with ...
