My book https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ was recently published by CRC Press (https://www.routledge.com/Beyond-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Applied-Generalized-Linear-Models-And/Roback-Legler/p/book/9781439885383), and I'm wondering if it could be featured on the bookdown homepage?  Its cover image can be found at https://images.routledge.com/common/jackets/amazon/978143988/9781439885383.jpg.  Thanks for considering!

One related question...  an earlier version of this book was also published on bookdown at https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-bysh/ (before the publisher suggested a name change).  Is it possible to set up a re-direct from the old version to the new version, or is it cleanest just to delete the old version?
